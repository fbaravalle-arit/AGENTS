2. Attention-Grabbing Hero Sections
The hero section is the most valuable real estate on your landing page. Make it count by featuring:
• A clear value proposition: One impactful sentence that conveys your startup’s unique benefit.
• A bold CTA: Action-oriented buttons like “Join the waitlist” or “Get started now.”
• Visuals: Screenshots, videos, or graphics that demonstrate your product in action.
Example: “Increase sales by 40% with AI-driven email marketing” paired with a prominent “Request a demo” button.
3. Building Trust Through Social Proof
Credibility is crucial, especially for early-stage startups. Use social proof to show why visitors should trust you:
• Customer logos: Showcase brands that use your product.
• Testimonials: Add quotes from happy customers or industry experts.
• Metrics: Highlight measurable success (e.g., “Used by 20,000+ businesses worldwide”).
Example: “Backed by Sequoia and YC. Trusted by Netflix, Stripe, and 15,000+ startups.”
4. Differentiation in 3 Bullet Points
Visitors skim—make it easy for them to understand your edge. YC startups distill their unique value into three bullet points that
focus on:
• Speed: “Onboard new hires in under 5 minutes.”
• Cost savings: “Save $10,000 annually on operational costs.”
• Ease of use: “No coding required to set up.”

• “Save $1,000/month on customer acquisition.”
• “Get started in less than 3 minutes.”
5. Action-Oriented CTAs That Convert
Every startup landing page needs a single, clear call-to-action (CTA) designed to guide visitors. Key characteristics include:
• Prominent placement: Always visible above the fold.
• Strong verbs: Use words like “Start,” “Get,” or “Join” to inspire action.
• Clarity: Ensure the CTA explains what happens next (e.g., “Start free trial” vs. “Learn more”).
Example: “Join the Waitlist” or “Download the Free Guide” are more compelling than generic phrases like “Contact Us.”
