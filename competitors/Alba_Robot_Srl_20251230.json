  "executive_summary": {
    "overview": "Alba Robot is an innovative Italian startup based in Turin, founded in 2019. It specializes in 'Micro-Mobility' and autonomous vehicle solutions for People with Reduced Mobility (PRM). The company aims to transform indoor pedestrian transport by converting passive wheelchairs into autonomous, self-driving fleets managed via a cloud platform.",
    "brand_details": "The brand blends deep tech (AI, robotics, IoT) with high-end Italian design (partnership with Italdesign). It positions itself as a 'Mobility-as-a-Service' provider rather than just a hardware manufacturer, emphasizing inclusivity, independence, and operational efficiency.",
    "market_positioning": "Alba Robot positions itself as the 'Waymo of pedestrian areas.' It targets the B2B enterprise market (Airports, Hospitals, Museums) rather than selling directly to consumers, differentiating through its fleet management capabilities and retrofitting technology that bridges the gap between manual aids and full autonomy."
